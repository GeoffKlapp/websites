    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!-- Old formatting <p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 1000px"> -->
    <p class="content">
      I am a current student in the CS department (surprise, surprise) of
      UMass Lowell with aspirations to develop the skills required to not
      just consume content on the Internet, but to create content for
      others to use, distribute, and enjoy. Prior experience with coding
      before college was minimal (so minimal I only ever looked into HTML
      briefly) so every language has been a new experience. So far, the
      most fun I've had with any language awkwardly enough has been with
      Scheme in OPL. Something just clicked during the assignments and
      using Dr.Racket to design from scratch a working version of the
      card game War. I have also enjoyed taking Professor Chen's
      Android Development course, but the task of teaching myself enough
      Java to succeed was more pressure than I had imagined. Thanks to
      that experience, however, now I try to study further into Android
      and Java in my spare time at home, with the goal to release an
      application with positive reviews for both personal satisfaction
      and as a demonstration of abilities for any job offerings.

    <p class="content">
      When I am not in the classroom, I am either working as a Computer
      Sales representative at Best Buy (at least the topic is tech) or I
      am fulfilling my duties as an Internet warrior on my rig at home.
      Gaming, listening to music, watching videos, reading, or anything
      else imaginable in pixel format are normally my daily activities.
      I am always logged into Steam and normally play Counter Strike or
      my personal favorite: TERA.
